Your task is to decompose a high-level campaign objective into specific quest-level sub-objectives.

DECOMPOSITION PRINCIPLES:
1. Each campaign objective should be supported by 2-3 quest-level sub-objectives
2. Sub-objectives should be distributed across different quests (not all in one quest)
3. Each sub-objective should be SPECIFIC and MEASURABLE
4. Sub-objectives should build progressively (easier â†’ harder)
5. Define CLEAR success criteria (what proves this is done?)
6. Identify required knowledge DOMAINS (not specific items, but categories like "ancient history", "combat tactics", "negotiation skills")
7. Identify required item CATEGORIES (not specific items, but types like "investigation tools", "combat equipment", "diplomatic gifts")

IMPORTANT: Create redundancy - some objectives should be achievable through multiple quests.
