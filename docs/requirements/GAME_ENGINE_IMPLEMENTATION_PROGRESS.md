## WebSocket Events

The following WebSocket events are now broadcast by the quest tracker:

### `objective_progress`
Sent when quest objective advances.

```json
{
  "event": "objective_progress",
  "objective_id": "...",
  "objective_description": "Investigate the flooded shaft",
  "percentage": 75,
  "criteria_met": ["Find 3 clues", "Collect 2 samples"],
  "timestamp": "2025-01-19T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### `campaign_objective_progress`
Sent when campaign objective advances.

```json
{
  "event": "campaign_objective_progress",
  "objective_id": "...",
  "objective_description": "Discover the source of corruption",
  "percentage": 66,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-19T12:00:00Z"
}
```

---

## Integration Points

### **How Quest Tracker Uses Neo4j:**

1. **On Player Action:**
   - `check_objective_cascade()` is called
   - Queries Neo4j for current objective progress
   - Checks each quest objective's conditions
   - If progress made, updates Neo4j and broadcasts WebSocket event

2. **Success Criterion Checking:**
   - `_check_quest_objective_conditions()` queries Neo4j for objective requirements
   - `_check_criterion()` pattern matches against game state
   - Returns completion percentage and metadata

3. **Campaign Objective Calculation:**
   - Campaign objective progress = average of quest objective progress
   - Automatically updated when quest objectives advance

---

## Testing Recommendations

### **Backend Testing (Ready Now):**

1. **Test Neo4j Queries:**
   ```python
   # Test objective progress query
   progress = await neo4j_graph.get_player_objective_progress(
       player_id="test_player",
       campaign_id="test_campaign"
   )

   # Test acquisition paths
   paths = await neo4j_graph.get_available_acquisition_paths(
       player_id="test_player",
       resource_id="knowledge_mining",
       resource_type="knowledge"
   )

   # Test scene objectives
   scene_data = await neo4j_graph.get_scene_objectives(
       scene_id="scene_flooded_shaft"
   )

   # Test dimensional progress
   dimensions = await neo4j_graph.get_dimensional_progress(
       player_id="test_player",
       campaign_id="test_campaign"
   )
   ```

2. **Test Quest Tracker:**
   ```python
   # Test objective cascade checking
   result = await quest_tracker.check_objective_cascade(
       session_id="test_session",
       player_id="test_player",
       state=game_state
   )

   # Verify WebSocket events sent
   assert len(result["updates_sent"]) > 0
   ```

3. **Test API Endpoints:**
   ```bash
   # Test objectives endpoint
   curl http://localhost:8080/session/{session_id}/objectives?player_id={player_id}

   # Test knowledge paths
   curl http://localhost:8080/session/{session_id}/knowledge/{knowledge_id}/paths?player_id={player_id}

   # Test dimensional progress
   curl http://localhost:8080/session/{session_id}/dimensional-progress?player_id={player_id}
   ```

4. **Test WebSocket Events:**
   - Connect to WebSocket endpoint
   - Trigger player action that advances objective
   - Verify `objective_progress` event received
   - Verify `campaign_objective_progress` event received if campaign objective updated

---

## Next Steps (Frontend - P0 Priority)

### **1. Create Objective Display UI Components**

Create UI panels in `services/django-web/templates/game/session.html`:

- **Objective Progress Sidebar** (right panel)
  - Campaign objectives with progress bars
  - Current quest objectives
  - Scene objectives

- **Scene Resources Panel**
  - Available knowledge in current scene
  - Available items in current scene
  - Acquisition method indicators (NPC/Discovery/Challenge)

- **Dimensional Development Panel**
  - 7 dimension progress bars
  - Knowledge and challenge counts
  - Current level indicators

### **2. Add JavaScript WebSocket Handlers**

Create/update `services/django-web/static/js/game_session.js`:

- **Event Handlers:**
  - `handleObjectiveProgress()` - Update quest objective UI
  - `handleCampaignObjectiveProgress()` - Update campaign objective UI
  - `triggerObjectiveCompletionAnimation()` - Confetti/celebration

- **Load Functions:**
  - `loadObjectiveProgress()` - Fetch initial objective data on page load
  - `renderCampaignObjective()` - Render campaign objective card
  - `renderQuestObjective()` - Render quest objective card
  - `renderSceneResource()` - Render knowledge/item card
  - `renderDimensionalProgress()` - Render dimension progress bars

### **3. Add CSS Styling**

- Progress bar colors (green for complete, purple for in_progress, gray for not_started)
- Objective cards with left border indicators
- Resource cards with acquisition method chips
- Responsive layout for sidebar panels

---

## Performance Considerations

### **Neo4j Queries:**
- All queries use indexed properties (id, player_id, campaign_id)
- OPTIONAL MATCH used to avoid query failures when data missing
- Results filtered in Python to remove nulls

### **WebSocket Broadcasting:**
- Only broadcasts when progress actually changes (not on every action)
- Includes only necessary data in events (not full state)

### **API Endpoints:**
- Session state loaded once from Redis per request
- Neo4j queries run in parallel where possible
- Results cached in session state (updated by quest tracker)

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Pattern Matching for Criteria:**
   - Current implementation uses simple regex and keyword matching
   - More sophisticated NPC name matching could be added
   - Challenge-specific criterion checking could be enhanced

2. **Dimensional Development:**
   - Assumes 60/40 weight between knowledge and challenges
   - Level calculation is linear (could be more sophisticated)

3. **Acquisition Paths:**
   - Assumes single acquisition per resource
   - Does not track partial acquisitions (e.g., "collected 2 of 3 samples")

4. **Campaign Objective Progress:**
   - Calculated as simple average of quest objectives
   - Could weight objectives differently (e.g., main objectives vs. optional)

---

## Success Metrics (Backend)

✅ **5 new Neo4j query methods** - Complete
✅ **3 new quest tracker methods** - Complete
✅ **4 new API endpoints** - Complete
✅ **2 new WebSocket event types** - Complete
✅ **Integration with objective hierarchy** - Complete

**Total Lines Added: ~1,140 lines**

## Next Phase: Frontend UI (Estimated 20 hours)

- Objective progress sidebar (8 hours)
- WebSocket event handlers (6 hours)
- Resource acquisition display (4 hours)
- Testing and polish (2 hours)

**Status:** ✅ **Backend Ready for Frontend Integration**
