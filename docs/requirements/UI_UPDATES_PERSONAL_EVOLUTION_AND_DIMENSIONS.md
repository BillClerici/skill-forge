## Character Detail View & Character Sheet Updates

### Date: 2025-01-13

---

## Summary of Changes

Updated the Character Detail view to clearly communicate the **dual progression system** and explain the difference between:
- **Personal Evolution Arc** (Wisdom & Meta-Cognitive Integration)
- **Dimensional Maturity Profile** (Specific Skills)

---

## Character Detail View Updates

### 1. Personal Evolution Arc Card (Enhanced)

**Location**: `character_detail.html` lines 327-439

**Added Components**:

#### A. Explanatory Header Box
```
"Your Wisdom & Integration"
Your Personal Evolution Arc represents your meta-cognitive development -
your ability to reflect on, integrate, and synthesize learning across
all 7 dimensions. It advances when you demonstrate balanced growth,
not just specialized skills.
```

**Purpose**: Immediately clarifies that this is about wisdom/integration, not just skills

#### B. Level-Specific Descriptive Text
Each level now shows its meaning:
- **Novice**: "Beginning your journey of awareness"
- **Apprentice**: "Developing understanding across multiple areas"
- **Journeyman**: "Applying knowledge practically across domains"
- **Expert**: "Analyzing patterns across dimensions"
- **Master**: "Evaluating with integrated judgment"
- **Grandmaster**: "Creating transformative synthesis"

#### C. Next Level Requirements Box
Shows exactly what's needed to advance:
- **Apprentice**: "Reach level 2+ in at least 5 dimensions"
- **Journeyman**: "Reach level 3+ in 4 dimensions, level 2+ in all dimensions"
- **Expert**: "Reach level 4+ in 3 dimensions, level 3+ in 6 dimensions"
- **Master**: "Reach level 5+ in 2 dimensions, level 4+ in 5 dimensions"
- **Grandmaster**: "Reach level 6 in 1 dimension, level 5+ in 4 dimensions, level 4+ in all dimensions"

**Includes coaching text**: "Focus on balanced growth across your weakest dimensions to advance your Personal Evolution Arc."

#### D. Grandmaster Achievement Display
When character reaches max level, shows:
```
🏆 Highest Evolution Achieved!
You have reached Grandmaster level - the pinnacle of Personal Evolution.
Continue to grow and share your wisdom with others.
```

---

### 2. Dimensional Maturity Profile Card (Enhanced)

**Location**: `character_detail.html` lines 441-518

**Added Components**:

#### A. Explanatory Header Box
```
"Your Specific Skills"
These 7 dimensions track your specific capabilities in each area.
Unlike Personal Evolution Arc (which requires balance), you can specialize
here - becoming a master in some dimensions while developing others.
```

**Purpose**: Clarifies that specialization is allowed and encouraged here

#### B. Updated Info Box
```
"How Dimensions Grow"
Every interaction is evaluated - conversations, discoveries, challenges,
and events all award experience points to relevant dimensions based on
your performance. As dimensions reach higher levels, your Personal Evolution
Arc advances when you demonstrate balanced growth across multiple areas.
```

**Purpose**: Explains the connection between dimensional growth and Personal Evolution Arc advancement

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Color Coding
- **Purple (🟣)** = Personal Evolution Arc (Wisdom)
- **Gold (🟡)** = Dimensional Maturity (Skills)

### 2. Icons
- **Self-improvement** icon for Personal Evolution Arc
- **Psychology** icon for Dimensional Maturity Profile

### 3. Language Clarity
| Personal Evolution Arc | Dimensional Maturity |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| "Wisdom & Integration" | "Specific Skills" |
| "Meta-cognitive development" | "Specific capabilities" |
| "Balanced growth" | "Specialization encouraged" |
| "Requires balance" | "Independent progression" |

### 4. Progressive Disclosure
- **Always visible**: Current level, progress visualization
- **Conditional**: Requirements box (hidden at Grandmaster)
- **Educational**: Info boxes explaining how systems work together

---

## Character Sheet Updates

### Recommendation for Character Sheet
The Character Sheet (character_sheet.html) should be updated similarly:

1. **Personal Evolution Arc Section** (Top)
   - Add explanatory box about wisdom/integration
   - Show next level requirements
   - Add level-specific descriptions

2. **Dimensional Maturity Section** (Below)
   - Add explanatory box about specific skills
   - Emphasize that specialization is allowed
   - Show connection to Personal Evolution Arc

---

## User Benefits

### 1. Clear Mental Model
Users now understand:
- ✅ Personal Evolution Arc = Overall wisdom (requires balance)
- ✅ Dimensional Maturity = Specific skills (allows specialization)
- ✅ How they work together (dimensions feed into arc)

### 2. Goal Clarity
Users can now answer:
- "What do I need to do to advance my Personal Evolution Arc?" → Check requirements box
- "Can I focus on just combat?" → Yes for dimensions, but need balance for arc
- "Why isn't my arc advancing even though I'm high in Physical?" → See balanced growth requirement

### 3. Strategic Gameplay
Users make informed decisions:
- **Specialist Build**: Max out 1-2 dimensions, accept lower Personal Evolution Arc
- **Balanced Build**: Develop all dimensions evenly, advance Personal Evolution Arc faster
- **Hybrid Build**: Specialize in some, maintain minimum levels in others

## Implementation Notes

### Icons Used
- `self_improvement` - Personal Evolution Arc
- `psychology` - Dimensional Maturity

- Gold (`var(--rpg-gold)`, `rgba(212, 175, 55, ...)`) - Dimensional Maturity

### Responsive Design

---

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

### 1. Gap Analysis Display
Show which specific dimensions need focus:
```
To reach Expert level, you need:
✅ 3 dimensions at level 4+ (Currently: 2)
   - Physical: Level 5 ✅
   - Emotional: Level 4 ✅
   - Intellectual: Level 3 ❌ (Need 100 more XP)
```

### 2. Progress Predictions
```
"At your current pace, you'll reach Expert in approximately 15 interactions if you focus on Intellectual and Social dimensions."
```

### 3. Character Archetype Suggestions
```
Your profile matches: "The Warrior Philosopher"
- High Physical & Spiritual
- Moderate in other areas
- Consider developing Social skills for leadership roles
