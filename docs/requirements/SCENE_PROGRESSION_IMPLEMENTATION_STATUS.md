   - Multiple acquisition paths for each knowledge/item
   - Combat, riddles, moral dilemmas, teamwork challenges

2. **Dimensional Balance Test**

   - Verify system recommends social/emotional challenges
   - Verify balanced campaigns target all dimensions

3. **Rubric Fairness Test**
   - 100 simulated player performances across all rubrics
   - Verify score distribution (25% each at levels 1-4)
   - Adjust criterion weights if needed

4. **Objective Completion Test**
   - Verify knowledge levels are correctly tracked

## 🎯 Quick Start: Next Implementation Session

### Recommended Order
1. **Phase 2 First**: Objective linking is foundational
2. **Phase 3 Second**: Rubrics enable evaluation
3. **Phase 4 Third**: Scene generation uses objectives + rubrics
4. **Phase 5 Fourth**: Progression tracking uses all above
5. **Phase 6 Last**: Test everything together

### Estimated Time per Phase
- Phase 2: 4-6 hours
- Phase 3: 6-8 hours (lots of templates)
- Phase 4: 4-6 hours
- Phase 5: 6-8 hours (database + logic)
- Phase 6: 8-12 hours (thorough testing)

**Total: 28-40 hours**

## 📝 Notes

### Design Decisions Made
- Chose 4 partial knowledge levels (25% increments) for granularity
- 7 dimensions covers whole-person development
- Bloom's 6 levels map to RPG progression well
- Rubric scores use weighted averages (familiar to educators)
- Multiple acquisition paths (2-4 per knowledge/item) for redundancy

### Open Questions to Resolve
1. Should dimensional balance be enforced or just recommended?
2. How to handle knowledge "decay" over time (forgetting)?
3. Should some dimensions have prerequisites? (e.g., Physical before Vocational for craftsman)
4. Combat lethality - how much emphasis on non-lethal resolution?
5. Multiplayer considerations - how do rubrics work for team activities?

### Future Enhancements (Post-Phase 6)
- Dynamic difficulty adjustment based on dimensional levels
- Adaptive campaign generation (targets weak dimensions)
- Mentor/teaching system (players can teach knowledge to others)
- Knowledge synthesis (combine multiple knowledge entities to create new ones)
- Dimensional synergies (bonuses when multiple dimensions are high)

---

**Implementation Status**: Phases 1-5 Complete ✅
**Blockers**: None
**Dependencies**: All phases 1-5 complete ✅

**Next Action**: Phase 6 - Testing & Refinement
