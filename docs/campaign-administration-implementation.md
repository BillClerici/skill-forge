- `/campaigns/wizard/init/` - Initialize workflow
- `/campaigns/wizard/story-selection/` - Story selection page
- `/campaigns/wizard/select-story/` - Select story action
- `/campaigns/wizard/regenerate-stories/` - Regenerate action

- `/campaigns/wizard/approve-core/` - Approve core action
- `/campaigns/wizard/progress/` - Progress page
- `/campaigns/wizard/status/` - Status API
- `/campaigns/wizard/complete/` - Completion page

## Campaign Workflow (22-Step Process)

### Phase 1: Initialization
1. User selects Character, Universe, World, Region
2. Optional user story idea input

### Phase 2: Story Generation
3. AI generates 3 diverse story ideas
4. User reviews story ideas
5. User can regenerate stories (unlimited)
6. User selects one story idea

### Phase 3: Campaign Core Generation
7. AI generates campaign name, plot, storyline
8. AI generates 3-5 primary objectives (with Bloom's levels)
9. User reviews campaign core
10. User specifies quest parameters (count, difficulty, playtime, images)

### Phase 4: Quest Generation
11. AI generates quests based on specifications
12. Each quest assigned to Level 1 location (existing or new)
13. Quests have 2-4 objectives with Bloom's levels

### Phase 5: Place Generation
14. AI generates 2-4 places per quest (Level 2 locations)
15. Places can use existing or create new Level 2 locations

### Phase 6: Scene Generation
16. AI generates 1-3 scenes per place (Level 3 locations)
17. Scenes can use existing or create new Level 3 locations

### Phase 7: Scene Element Generation
18. AI determines what each scene needs
19. NPCs generated using NPC subgraph (with species association)
20. Discoveries, Events, Challenges generated for scenes

### Phase 8: Finalization
21. Validation of all campaign data
22. Persistence to MongoDB, Neo4j, PostgreSQL
23. Full audit trail saved
24. Campaign ready to play

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. LangGraph Workflow Orchestration
- **9 Discrete Phases** with conditional routing
- **Human-in-the-Loop Gates** at story selection and core approval
- **Retry Logic** with max retries (3)
- **Error Handling** with graceful degradation
- **Audit Trail** for all workflow actions
- **Checkpointing** for rollback capability

### 2. AI Generation with Bloom's Taxonomy
- **Educational Integration** - All objectives tagged with Bloom's levels (1-6)
- **Progressive Complexity** - Quests build on each other
- **Character-Appropriate** - Target Bloom's level from character profile
- **Cognitive Skill Tracking** - Educational progress monitoring

### 3. World Persistence Strategy
- **New Species** created during campaign become permanent world assets
- **New Locations** (L1, L2, L3) enrich the world permanently
- **New NPCs** added to world's NPC pool (reusable)
- **AI Evaluation** - Determines if existing entities fit before creating new

### 4. Hierarchical Location System
- **Region (L0)** - Geographic features (Continent, Forest, etc.)
- **Level 1** - Settlements/major features (City, Town, Cave System)
- **Level 2** - Buildings/sub-areas (Tavern, Shop, Temple)
- **Level 3** - Rooms/specific spaces (The Bar, Kitchen, Chamber)
- **Parent-Child Coherence** - Children are smaller, contained concepts

### 5. Multi-Database Persistence
- **MongoDB** - Campaign documents (flexible schema)
- **Neo4j** - Relationships (graph queries for narrative flow)
- **PostgreSQL** - Analytics (structured reporting)
- **Redis** - State management and caching

### 6. Real-Time Progress Tracking
- **Progress Percentage** - Visual progress bar
- **Phase Information** - Current workflow phase
- **Progress Log** - Detailed activity log
- **Error Display** - Real-time error reporting
- **AJAX Polling** - 2-second updates

### 7. NPC Generation with Species Association
- **Species Evaluation** - AI determines if existing species are appropriate
- **New Species Creation** - Creates new species if needed
- **Personality Generation** - Unique traits, backstory, dialogue style
- **Role Assignment** - quest_giver, merchant, enemy, ally, neutral

### 8. RabbitMQ Event-Driven Architecture
- **Asynchronous Processing** - Workflow runs in background
- **Scalable** - Multiple campaign-factory instances
- **Queue: `campaign_generation_queue`**
- **Workflow Actions:** start, select_story, regenerate_stories, approve_core

### 9. Cost Tracking & Throttling
- **AI Cost Monitoring** - Track OpenAI/Anthropic costs
- **Budget Limits** - Per subscription tier
- **Automatic Throttling** - Prevent overspending
- **Redis-Based** - Fast cost tracking

### Verification

Check MongoDB:
```javascript
use skillforge
db.campaigns.findOne({_id: "campaign_<request_id>"})
db.quests.find({campaign_id: "campaign_<request_id>"})
db.places.find({campaign_id: "campaign_<request_id>"})
db.scenes.find({campaign_id: "campaign_<request_id>"})
db.npcs.find({origin_campaign_id: "campaign_<request_id>"})
```

Check Neo4j:
```cypher
MATCH (c:Campaign {id: "campaign_<request_id>"})-[r]->(n)
RETURN c, r, n
LIMIT 100
```

Check RabbitMQ:
```
http://localhost:15672/
